$NANO wallet application for Ledger Nano S

To use the $NANO Ledger app with web wallets, make sure that the "Browser support" is turned on.

## For wallet developers

If you wish to integrate your $NANO web wallet with Ledger, then you can use the [hw-app-nano](https://github.com/roosmaa/hw-app-nano/) JavaScript library that works in tandem with [ledgerjs](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs) library.

For desktop wallet apps, there is no integration library at the time. But you can still interact with the device using the binary protocol detailed in [the ADPU documentation](https://github.com/roosmaa/blue-app-nano/blob/master/doc/nano.md).
